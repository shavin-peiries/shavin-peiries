- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Shavin!
- ðŸ‘€ I wake up in the morning because building a business is complicated. I want to make it simple. Especially the part where you have to talk to customers. That's really hard to do. It has to be unbiased, friendly and you've got to ask the right questions. But that's not all! After, you've got to look for patterns, identify new challenges, design solutions and guide the team to build it
